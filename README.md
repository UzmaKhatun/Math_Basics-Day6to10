# 📘 10 Days of Machine Learning – Day 6 to Day 10

Welcome to **Week 2** of my #10DaysOfMachineLearning challenge!  
In this phase, I am diving into the **core mathematics** required for understanding and implementing Machine Learning algorithms. These are the building blocks that help us grasp what's going on "under the hood."
